                You get infront of your old computer, the monitor has a big tube that you hate.
                You start working on your shitty duties, you do repetive things, those that should have been done by an automatic system.
                Your only break is looking at the social media (it's actually forbidden in the office, but you found a backdoor).
                You see a picture of a friend of yours at the beach. He's with your ex-wife and her new boyfriend.
                You had actually blocked your ex and her boyfriend, so that you wouldn't see them once again. But it doesn't work if they are shown in another person's picture.
                The couple looks so happy together. She looks happier this time, compared to the time she was with you.
