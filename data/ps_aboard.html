                After the train stops, you get in it with the crowd of commuters. And it departs.
                After 13 minutes, you arrive at the ugly gray skyscraper that you call "Office building".
                At the entrance of your office (at the 13th floor of the skyscraper), you see your boss.
                <br> 
                He is the man you hate the most. An overweight, bald man with a black moustache.
                You always wanted to murder hum, but you always controlled your anger somehow. 
                Because once you react in anger, you completely lose control of yourself.
                <br><br>He stares at you.
