                "Let me show you, then. You won't like it."
                Television shows your ex-wife's face. She's crying with despair.
                A 9mm pistol gets in the frame, it's pointed at her head.
                <br><br><span style="color: red;">Trigger gets pulled and she's dead</span><br><br>
                The camera now shows the man who pulled the trigger: You!
                You see yourself crying like a baby. You killed her, but you still loved her.
                <br>
                The screen fades away. What will you do?
