                At evening time a police officer comes to your cell. "You have a vistor!", he says.<br>
                A woman with a long red coat approaches the bars.
                The most interesting part is her wearing a Venice mask on her face.<br>
                Her face isn't visible but you recognize the woman by her body and black hair: She's your ex-wife!<br>
                <br>
                She turns to the policeman, "Leave me alone with him," she orders the man. He leaves the room.
