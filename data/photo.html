                This photograph shows you with your ex-wife at the beach, when you were on your honeymoon. She has a long black hair, brown eyes and a pretty face. She was the prettiest woman for you when you were together. You both look so happy in this frame, with sincere smiles.
                But it's past.
                You feel a terrible guilt looking at this picture.
