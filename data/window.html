                You are at the 13th (and top) floor of the apartment building.
                The sky is covered with gray clouds, its grayness is reflected upon everything you see. People are walking in a hurry, some of them don't have umbrellas on this rainy morning.
                There are no green tress; only high, concrete structures.
                There isn't any trace of happiness out there.
            </p>
