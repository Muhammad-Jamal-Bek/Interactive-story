                You wear your suit and head off for work.
                It's a rainy day, but you have lost your umbrella. 
                You get wet till you reach the subway station, it takes about 13 minutes to reach there.
                <br><br>
                While descending the stairs to the subway station 
                you pass by two teenagers smoking cigarettes, they're 13 years old at most.
                You overhear one of them say:<span style="color: seagreen;">"I watch TV to remember."</span>
                <br>
                You never wanted to have kids, they would probably be like those teenagers who began smoking at this early age. 
                You took a sterilization operation a few years ago, but your wife didn't know about it.
