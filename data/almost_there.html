                Something you never could expect starts happening.<br><br>
                You start feeling that you're waking up from the dream. But you're not in your bed now!
                <br> You're still in the kitchen but as an enitity without a body!<br><br>
                It's impossible to say at which point you've become a three dimensional space.
                Your presence covers all the kitchen and you see everything.<br><br>
                You see the lying bodies of two dead people: Your wife and yourself. 
                Theres a gun in your hand, and a bullet hole in both of the bodies heads.
