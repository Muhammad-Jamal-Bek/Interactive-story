                You regain consciousness right after a loud gun shot!<br><br>
                Your wife was on her knees, and now she starts falling back with the impact of the bullet
                shot into her head. The gun which killed her, is held by your trembling hands.<br><br>
                You loved her more than anything else in the world, <span style="color: red;">now you see her lying dead with her brain
                and blood splattered onto the whole kitchen.</span><br><br>
                You breakdown in tears and immediately shoot yourself in the head...
