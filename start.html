            <p>
                You wake up in your bed.
                You wish you were dead. In fact, you should have been dead. You committed suicide lots of times before. 
                But no, there is no after-life for you, only the repeat of the same day.
                Not only you hate your never-ending day, but also yourself.<br><br>
                You have an obligation to go to work. You hate your job and the small cubicle in the cold office.
                Maybe you'll do something crazy today, or maybe spend the day at home? <br>
                Perhaps kill yourself?
